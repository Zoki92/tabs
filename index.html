                    Independent Accommodation
                    Independent accommodation within the private rented sector Evolve acts as a social lettings agency
                    providing good quality and affordable private accommodation with integrated support. Evolve manages
                    a wide range of private rented accommodation across Norfolk. This enables us to ensure we can
                    provide safe and comfortable accommodation of a high standard where the young person wants to live.


                    This accommodation may be sole occupancy, shared accommodation with floating support, or shared
                    accommodation with integrated support via a peer landlord. It is our aim that, over time, our young
                    people will achieve the skills required to manage their tenancies successfully, thus allowing them
                    to remain our tenants even when we are no longer actively supporting them in other areas. The size
                    of our housing stock means that we are able to make a long term commitment to our tenants and will
                    be able to provide accommodation opportunities as their lives move on and accommodation needs
                    change.

                    Supported Lodgings
                    Evolve recruits a range of people who are able to offer accommodation within their own homes and a
                    level of support appropriate to the needs of the young person. Our supported lodgings providers are
                    assessed, vetted, and trained to a high standard. As an organisation we use the fostering
                    regulations and national minimum standards to guide our training and assessment process. Our
                    providers have access to 24 hour support and advice 7 days a week, 52 weeks of the year. This level
                    of support enables our supported lodgings providers to offer, when required, a high level of support
                    to vulnerable young people with additional needs. Our out of hour’s service also means that we are
                    able to consider emergency placements. However, it is our expectation that most of the young people
                    we work with will come to us in a planned and prepared manner.

                    Taster Tenancies
                    For young people who are unsure whether they are ready for independent accommodation, we can offer a
                    tenancy trial. In most cases this will be for a period of at least two weeks. The young person’s
                    usual accommodation must remain available to them during this period.

                    Flexibility in Accommodation Provision
                    We appreciate that sometimes young people’s circumstances and accommodation needs change. We will be
                    able to respond to this whether their needs increase or decrease, or if they require a move to a
                    different type of accommodation or area. It is our expectation that some of our young people may
                    move through our accommodation services as part of a planned process, perhaps starting in supported
                    lodgings, moving to shared accommodation and then to their own tenancy when they feel ready and able
                    to manage this level of responsibility. It is our desire to be a flexible landlord, and as such we
                    will seek to facilitate a rapid response in situations where a young person is not coping. Therefore
                    such tenancies may be terminated by mutual consent during the fixed term, where it is in the best
                    interests of the young person and is not detrimental to the viability of our business.
